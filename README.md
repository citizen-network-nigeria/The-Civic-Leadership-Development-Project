# The-Civic-Leadership-Development-Project
The Civic Leadership Development Project (The Civic Club Project) is an intervention project designed to identify young talents, prepare them for civic participation, instigate behavioral and attitudinal changes and equip them with leadership values and skills that will empower them to make positive impact in the long term.
The overall purpose of the Civic Club Project is to create a platform that will identify, nurture and raise a new crop of young leaders imbued with leadership, civic and shared social values that will enable them to become change drivers in their community in the nearest future.
The project will be run as a Civic Club in secondary schools and tertiary institutions across the country.
